# Sales Prediction Model
The aim of this project is to build a predictive model to find out the sales of each of 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities collected by BigMart company. 
Based on the model, the decision makers at BigMart can have some proofs to determine the properties of any product or store, which play a key role in increasing overall sales. 

The programming language used to build the model is R.

They provided me with 3 CSV files: Train, Test, and Outcome. 
The Train file contains 11 independent variables and 1 target variable, i.e., Items_Outlet_Sales
The Test file contains the same set of independent variables but without target variable column whose values are what we have to predict
The Outcome file contains the prediction of sales
