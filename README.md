# Sales Prediction Model
The aim of this project is to build a predictive model to find out the sales of each of 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities collected by BigMart company. 
Based on the model, the decision makers at BigMart can have some proofs to determine the properties of any product or store, which play a key role in increasing overall sales. 
The programming language used to build the model is R.
